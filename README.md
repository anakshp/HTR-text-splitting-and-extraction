# HTR-text-splitting-and-extraction
This repository contains Python scripts developed for a project with the Noord-Hollands Archief. The pipeline processes HTR-transcribed historical court records by:  1. Splitting long OCR/HTR text files into individual verdicts 2. Extracting structured metadata from each verdict using OpenAI API.
